Our new paper [Kernel Ridge Regression with Predicted Feature Inputs and Applications to Factor-Based Nonparametric Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20022) is available on arXiv. It provides a sharp prediction risk guarantee for kernel ridge regression when the true regression features must be predicted.
