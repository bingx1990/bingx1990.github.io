Our new paper [Convergence and Optimality of the EM Algorithm Under Multi-Component Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08237) is available on arXiv. We establish the minimax optimal rate of convergence of the EM algorithm for multi-component GMMs in full generality. The required separation condition between Gaussian components for EM to converge is the weakest known to date.
